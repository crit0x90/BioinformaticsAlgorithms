# BioinformaticsAlgorithms

The purpose of this project will be to gain experience in the field of bioinformatics.  The algorithms that will be represented here will be chosen from the book "An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms" by Neil C. Jones and Pavel A. Pevzner.

Additionally, I plan to add a few files that summarize some of the basic molecular biology concepts that are covered in the book as a reference. I have decided to study all of the 
algorithms represented in the book but only implement the optimal solutions.
